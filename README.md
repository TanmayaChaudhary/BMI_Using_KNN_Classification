# BMI_Using_KNN_Classification
In this project we build a ML model which is work on KNN Classification to find out the BMI of a person.

## Installation:
* numpy
* pandas
* sklearn

## Files Description:
* **Bmi_male_female.csv** it is the data set of the people.
* **BMI_Using_KNN_Classification.ipynb** a jupyter notebook which contains code of this project with description.

## Project Motivation:
We build a Machine Learning model that is used for prediction of BMI of person.

## Result:
Finally we have the model with the accuracy of 91.33 % accuracy.
